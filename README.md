# Tex Writing Setup

This repository is bundling rust tools like tectonic and just with an example structure to enable academic writing out of the box.

## Installation

Just copy the below commands.

### Installing Rust

#### Linux & MacOS

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update
```


## Motivation

Since most tools are either slow or add unnecessary complexity I tried to keep it powerful enough to justify the additional dependencies.
