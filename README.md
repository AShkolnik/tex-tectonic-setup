# Tex Tectonic Setup

This repository is a setup configuration to making writing LaTeX documents easier.
The idea is to use Tectonic together with Just to allow fast and deterministic out-of-the-box development in LaTeX.

## Installation

Just copy the below commands.

### Installing Rust

#### Linux & MacOS

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup update
```


## Motivation

Since most tools are either slow or add unnecessary complexity I tried to keep it powerful enough to justify the additional dependencies.
